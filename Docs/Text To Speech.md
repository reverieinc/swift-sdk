                private var tts=TextToSpeech(apikey:API_KEY, appId: APP_ID)
      
    ```

2. Implement the Delegates in the Struct or Class for getting the results. 
    ```sh 
        struct TTS_UI: View,TTSDelegate {
       
        func onResult(data: Data) {
            playAudio(data: data)
        }
    
        func onError(data: String) {
        
        }
               
    ```
3. Attach the Delegates to the Text to Speech Class
    ```sh
         tts.setDelegate(ttsDelegate: self) // attach this after init in case of ViewController and after onAppear in Case of Swiftui
    ```

4.  Call the Text to Speech Function
    ```sh
        tts.callTTS(text: textInput, speaker: SelectedSpeaker)
        
    ```

5.  To Set the Speed(Optional)
    ```sh
    tts.setSpeed(1.5)
    ```
